# Hi, I'm Kris 👋

**Self-Taught AI Engineer | Healthcare Technology Enthusiast**

I build AI-powered applications that solve real problems in healthcare, with a focus on patient safety, privacy, and bridging gaps in care delivery. Focusing on **Ethical AI** integration that solves real-world problems for people who need care most when they think there is so little to be found.

## 🏥 My Unique Background

- **Health Sciences degree** from UCF + **Clinical training in Radiation Therapy**
- **Financial Services Compliance** experience at Deutsche Bank
- Self-taught developer specializing in **healthcare AI applications** while caregiving
- Deep understanding of regulatory requirements (HIPAA, compliance frameworks) and clinical workflows
- Passionate about using technology to improve patient outcomes and healthcare accessibility

**Why this combination matters**: I understand healthcare from three critical angles—clinical care, regulatory compliance, and technology implementation. I've seen how medical technology impacts real patients, navigated complex compliance requirements, and now build AI solutions that bridge these worlds responsibly.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

- **MedJournee**: AI-powered medical conversation transcription with real-time translation for families with limited English proficiency (Currently redesigning privacy architecture)
- **MedTracker**: Medication reminder and adherence tracking application
- Exploring: AI-assisted tools for patients with communication barriers

## 💻 Technical Skills

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python (FastAPI, Flask)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

**AI/ML:**
- OpenAI Whisper (Speech Recognition)
- Natural Language Processing
- Google Translate API integration
- Model evaluation and selection

**Healthcare Tech:**
- HIPAA compliance principles
- Protected Health Information (PHI) handling
- Healthcare workflow understanding
- Currently learning: HL7, FHIR standards

**Development Practices:**
- RESTful API design
- Database architecture
- Privacy-first development
- Git version control

## 🎯 Currently Learning

- Healthcare data interoperability standards (HL7, FHIR)
- Advanced NLP techniques for medical text
- TypeScript and React for frontend development
- Healthcare system integration patterns

## 🌟 What Drives Me

I'm motivated by the intersection of AI and healthcare—particularly projects that:
- Improve healthcare accessibility for underserved populations
- Address real patient safety and care quality issues
- Respect patient privacy and data security
- Bridge communication gaps in medical settings

Coming from a Health Sciences background, I understand clinical workflows and patient needs. My compliance experience taught me the critical importance of regulatory requirements. Now I'm combining these with AI engineering to build solutions that are both innovative and responsible.
